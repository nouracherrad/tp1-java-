## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate various operations on strings, arrays, and student grades. Each exercise is structured in a dedicated folder, with classes to handle core functionalities and a `Main` class for testing. These projects showcase fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditions, arrays, and string manipulations.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1:  Grade Management
This program manages student grades by offering several operations, including sorting grades, calculating the average grade, identifying the highest and lowest grades, and counting students with a particular grade.

- **Classes**:
  - `gerernote`: Contains methods for sorting grades, calculating average, finding max/min grades, and counting students.
  - `Main`: Used for testing the `gerernote` functionalities with sample grades.

### Exercise 2: Conjugation of First-Group Verbs
This program reads a French verb of the first group (ending in "-er") and conjugates it in the present tense.

- **Classes**:
  - `conjugaison`: Contains a method to conjugate verbs in the present tense.
  - `Main`: Used for testing the `conjugaison` class by reading a verb and displaying its conjugation.

### Exercise 3: String Operations
This program performs a set of operations on a user-inputted string. The user can choose to display the string, reverse it, count the number of words, or enter a new string.

- **Classes**:
  - `operationSurChaine`: Contains methods to input, display, reverse the string, and count words.
  - `Main`: Used to provide a menu for selecting and testing each string operation.

### Exercise 4: Character Occurrence Counter
This program counts the occurrences of each letter in a string inputted by the user, ignoring case sensitivity, and displays only letters that appear at least once.

- **Classes**:
  - `OccurrenceLettres`: Contains a method to count and display letter occurrences.
  - `Main`: Used for testing `OccurrenceLettres` by inputting a string and viewing the results.

## Conclusion
These exercises illustrate practical applications of Java programming skills, especially focusing on string manipulation, arrays, and control structures. Each exercise provides a specific functionality, making the code modular and reusable. The repository structure facilitates easy navigation and testing for each individual program.

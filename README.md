Pour un bon fichier README, vous pouvez inclure une brève introduction au projet, une explication de chaque exercice, et les noms des classes principales. Voici un exemple de structure de README pour votre dépôt :

Student Exercises Project
This repository contains four Java exercises designed to demonstrate various programming concepts, such as string manipulation, array operations, and conjugation of verbs. Each exercise is structured in a separate class, and they offer useful functionalities for learning Java.

Table of Contents
Exercise 1 - Managing Student Grades
Exercise 2 - Conjugating French Verbs
Exercise 3 - String Operations
Exercise 4 - Counting Letter Occurrences
Exercise 1 - Managing Student Grades
Class Name: Gerernote

This exercise provides a program to manage student grades, including:

Sorting and displaying the grades.
Calculating the average grade.
Finding the minimum and maximum grades.
Counting students with non-zero grades.
Exercise 2 - Conjugating French Verbs
Class Name: Conjugaison

In this exercise, the program reads a regular first-group French verb (ending in "er") and displays its conjugation in the present tense. The program verifies the verb’s ending and handles the conjugation rules.

Exercise 3 - String Operations
Class Name: OperationSurChaine

This program offers several operations on a user-input string, including:

Displaying the string.
Reversing the string.
Counting the number of words in the string (using whitespace as the delimiter).
Exercise 4 - Counting Letter Occurrences
Class Name: OccurrenceLettres

This program reads a string and counts the occurrences of each letter (A-Z) in a case-insensitive manner. Only letters that appear at least once are displayed.

Usage
To execute each exercise, navigate to the class of interest and run its main method. Each class contains specific methods for the operations listed above.

Add this README.md to your repository, and you’ll be set! Let me know if you need any other details.
